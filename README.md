> **AI-powered Gmail automation skill.** Turn your inbox into an automation hub: create email rules, get AI-summarized digests, auto-triage important messages, and connect Gmail with Slack, Notion, Google Calendar, Linear, and HubSpot — all from natural-language commands.

## Install

```bash
npx skills add tourmind-com/mailclaw
```

## Quick Start

1. Open the skill — it will guide you through setup
2. Paste your API key from https://aauth-170125614655.asia-northeast1.run.app/dashboard
3. Connect Gmail via OAuth
4. Read `setup.md` and register the heartbeat tasks defined there
5. Create your first rule from a template

## What It Does

**Server-side** (automatic): Gmail Pub/Sub receives new emails → AI analyzes intent, summarizes, matches rules → stores results.

**Skill** (conversational): Fetches pre-analyzed results, presents them, and executes user-confirmed actions.

**Heartbeat** (scheduled): Polls for new emails every minute, plus daily digests at 09:00 and 17:00.
